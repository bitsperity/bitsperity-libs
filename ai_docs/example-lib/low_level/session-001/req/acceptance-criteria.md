# Acceptance Criteria - Session 001

## Installation & Setup

### AC-001: Package Installation
**Given** a fresh SvelteKit project
**When** developer runs `npm install example-lib`
**Then** package installs without errors in <30 seconds
**And** TypeScript definitions are automatically available

### AC-002: First Integration
**Given** package is installed
**When** developer imports and uses basic functionality
**Then** integration works within 5 minutes
**And** full IDE support is available

## Core Functionality

### AC-003: Store Reactivity
**Given** store is initialized with data
**When** data is updated via store methods
**Then** components re-render within 16ms
**And** memory usage remains stable

### AC-004: HTTP Operations
**Given** API client is configured
**When** CRUD operations are performed
**Then** requests complete successfully
**And** errors are handled gracefully

## SvelteKit Integration

### AC-005: Form Actions
**Given** form action is implemented
**When** form is submitted
**Then** progressive enhancement works
**And** both JS/no-JS scenarios function

### AC-006: SSR Compatibility
**Given** app uses server-side rendering
**When** page loads
**Then** no hydration mismatches occur
**And** state is consistent server/client

## Performance Criteria

### AC-007: Bundle Size
**Given** library is built for production
**When** bundle analysis is performed
**Then** core bundle is <20KB gzipped
**And** full library is <50KB gzipped

### AC-008: Runtime Performance
**Given** library is used in production app
**When** performance monitoring is enabled
**Then** 99th percentile response time <100ms
**And** memory usage grows <1MB per hour

## Quality Gates

### AC-009: Test Coverage
**Given** test suite is executed
**When** coverage report is generated
**Then** line coverage is >90%
**And** branch coverage is >85%

### AC-010: Type Safety
**Given** library is used with TypeScript strict mode
**When** code is compiled
**Then** no type errors occur
**And** full inference is available
