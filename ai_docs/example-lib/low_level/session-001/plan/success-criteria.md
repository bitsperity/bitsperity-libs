# Success Criteria - Testing Gates (Session 001)

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Automated Tests
- [ ] **TypeScript**: 0 compilation errors with strict mode
- [ ] **Build**: Production build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Basic store creation test passes
- [ ] **Bundle**: Generates valid ESM and CJS outputs

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Type Coverage**: 100% for all exported APIs
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Foundation bundle <5KB gzipped
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Only peer dependencies (Svelte/SvelteKit)
- [ ] **Documentation**: All public APIs have JSDoc comments

### Manual Validation
- [ ] **IDE Support**: TypeScript autocomplete works in VS Code
- [ ] **Installation**: `npm install` succeeds in fresh project
- [ ] **Import**: Basic import and usage works

## Phase 2: Core Store System

### Automated Tests
- [ ] **Store Contract**: Svelte store compatibility tests pass
- [ ] **Reactivity**: Component reactivity tests pass
- [ ] **Events**: Event system tests (on/off) pass
- [ ] **Memory**: Memory leak tests pass (no growth after cleanup)

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: >85% line coverage for store module
- [ ] **Performance**: Store updates <16ms (60fps compatible)
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Core bundle <15KB gzipped
- [ ] **Memory**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Manual Validation
- [ ] **Svelte Integration**: Works in actual Svelte component
- [ ] **Developer Experience**: Store usage feels intuitive

## Phase 3: HTTP Client Integration

### Automated Tests
- [ ] **CRUD Operations**: All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) tested
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Network error scenarios covered
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff tests pass
- [ ] **Authentication**: Auth integration tests pass

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: >90% line coverage for client module
- [ ] **Error Coverage**: All error types have test cases
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Client bundle <25KB gzipped
- [ ] **Network Resilience**: Handles offline/slow connections

### Manual Validation
- [ ] **API Integration**: Works against real API endpoints
- [ ] **Error Experience**: Error messages are helpful and actionable

## Phase 4: SvelteKit Integration

### Automated Tests
- [ ] **Form Actions**: Progressive enhancement tests pass
- [ ] **SSR**: Server-side rendering tests pass
- [ ] **Hydration**: No hydration mismatch errors
- [ ] **Environment**: Server/client detection tests pass

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: >85% line coverage for integration module
- [ ] **SSR Compatibility**: No browser-only code in SSR path
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Full integration <40KB gzipped
- [ ] **Performance**: No SSR performance degradation

### Manual Validation
- [ ] **SvelteKit App**: Integration works in real SvelteKit project

- [ ] **Development Experience**: Hot reload works properly

## Phase 5: Production Readiness

### Automated Tests
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Complete user journey tests pass
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Bundle size regression tests pass
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Full library integration tests pass
- [ ] **CI/CD**: Automated release pipeline works

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Overall Coverage**: >90% test coverage across all modules
- [ ] **Bundle Size Target**: Total library <50KB gzipped achieved
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: All performance targets met
- [ ] **Documentation**: 100% API documentation coverage

### Manual Validation
- [ ] **Example App**: Demonstrates all major features
- [ ] **Documentation**: Getting started guide works end-to-end
- [ ] **Release Process**: NPM package publishing ready

## Cross-Phase Quality Standards

### Continuous Requirements
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any` types in public APIs
- **Testing**: New features must include tests
- **Documentation**: Public APIs must have JSDoc
- **Performance**: No performance regressions allowed

### Automated Monitoring
- **Bundle Size**: Automatic size monitoring in CI
- **Test Coverage**: Coverage reports generated for all phases
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode enforced
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier checks pass
