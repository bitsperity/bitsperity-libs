- [ ] CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Error handling mit Result types
- [ ] Retry logic mit exponential backoff
- [ ] Authentication integration
- [ ] Client configuration system
- [ ] HTTP client test suite

### Phase Completion Criteria

## Phase 4: SvelteKit Integration (Week 4)

### Scope & Boundaries
**IN SCOPE:**
- Form actions implementation
- SSR compatibility features
- SvelteKit-specific optimizations
- Progressive enhancement support
- Environment detection

**OUT OF SCOPE:**

- [ ] Progressive enhancement patterns
- [ ] SvelteKit integration helpers
- [ ] Integration test suite

### Phase Completion Criteria
- Form actions work mit and without JavaScript
- SSR compatibility validated
- No hydration mismatches
- SvelteKit integration seamless

## Phase 5: Production Readiness (Week 5)

### Scope & Boundaries
**IN SCOPE:**
- Bundle optimization and analysis
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example applications
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Performance optimization

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Major feature additions
- Breaking API changes
- Advanced monitoring
- Complex deployment strategies

**DEPENDENCIES:** Phase 4 (SvelteKit Integration)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Bundle size optimization (<50KB target)
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Example SvelteKit application
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Release preparation

### Phase Completion Criteria
- Bundle size meets targets
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Example app demonstrates all features
- All quality gates pass
- Ready for NPM publication

## Inter-Phase Dependencies

### Dependency Chain
```
Phase 1 (Foundation) 
  ↓
Phase 2 (Store System)
  ↓  
Phase 3 (HTTP Client)
  ↓
Phase 4 (SvelteKit Integration)
  ↓
Phase 5 (Production Ready)
```

### Rollback Strategy
- Each phase must pass all success criteria before proceeding
- Failed phases require completion before moving forward
- Breaking changes in later phases may require earlier phase updates
- Maintain working version at end of each phase

**Planning Status**: 5 phases defined, max 1 week each
**Total Timeline**: 5 weeks for complete implementation
**Risk Mitigation**: Clear dependencies and rollback strategy defined
