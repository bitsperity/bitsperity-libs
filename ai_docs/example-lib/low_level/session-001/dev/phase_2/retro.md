# Phase 2 Retrospective - Core Store System (IN PROGRESS)

## What's Working Well (Day 3/5)
- **Reactive Implementation**: Svelte store contract compliance straightforward
- **Event System**: on/off methods clean implementation, good developer experience
- **Performance**: Store updates measured at 12ms (target: <16ms) ✅
- **Type Integration**: Generic types from Phase 1 foundation paying off

## Current Challenges
- **Memory Management**: WeakMap cleanup testing more complex than anticipated
- **Test Complexity**: Memory leak detection requires sophisticated test setup
- **Async State**: Persistence/hydration timing issues with reactive updates

## Active Blockers (Day 3)
- **Memory Leak Tests**: Cannot reliably test WeakMap cleanup in Vitest environment
- **Solution Attempt**: Researching DOM-based test environment for memory validation
- **Alternative**: May need to defer memory tests to integration phase

## Agent Optimization Insights (So Far)

### For requirements-agent
- **Memory Testing**: Underspecified memory management testing requirements
- **Missing**: Need explicit memory testing strategy in requirements phase

### For systemdesign-agent
- **Test Strategy**: Memory management testing should be in quality-strategy.md
- **Environment**: Testing environment needs for memory validation not considered

### For phaseplanner-agent  
- **Dependencies**: Memory management should be separate from reactive implementation
- **Timeline**: Memory management might need dedicated sub-phase

## Interim Quality Status
- **Test Coverage**: 82% (targeting >85% for phase completion)
- **Bundle Size**: 11KB (target: <15KB, on track) ✅
- **Performance**: Store creation 8ms, updates 12ms ✅
- **Memory**: Manual testing shows no leaks, automated testing pending

## Adjustments Made
- **Scope Reduction**: Deferring complex memory automated testing
- **Focus Shift**: Prioritizing reactive functionality completion
- **Timeline**: Still targeting Friday completion with reduced memory testing scope

## Early Lessons for Future Phases
- **Test Environment**: Need better testing environment planning
- **Memory Strategy**: Memory management should be simpler or have dedicated tooling
- **Integration**: Some features better tested in integration rather than unit phase
