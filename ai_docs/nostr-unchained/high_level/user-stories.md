# Enhanced Developer User Stories

## Core Stories (Priority 1) - The Magical "First 5 Minutes"

### As a developer building social apps, I want to create and send events effortlessly
**So that** Nostr feels as simple as posting to a traditional database

**Enhanced with Research**: Based on competitive analysis, existing libraries require 10+ lines für basic event creation. Nostr Unchained's fluent API reduces this zu 3 lines.

**Magic Moment:**
```typescript
await nostr.events.create()
  .content("Hello Nostr!")
  .sign()           // Auto-detects Alby/NIP-07
  .send();          // Auto-discovers best relays
```

**Success Metric**: Developer creates first event in <30 seconds

### As a SvelteKit developer, I want reactive Nostr data stores
**So that** my UI automatically updates when events change

**Enhanced with Research**: Current Svelte integrations (ndk-svelte, svelte-nostr) haben limited adoption. Nostr Unchained positions as first Svelte-optimized solution.

**Magic Moment:**
```typescript
const eventStore = nostr.query().kinds([1]).createStore();
$: posts = $eventStore; // Automatic reactivity
```

**Success Metric**: Live UI updates without polling or manual refresh

### As a developer, I want to query complex event relationships easily  
**So that** I can build social features without understanding Nostr's complexity

**Enhanced with Research**: No existing library provides subgraph traversal APIs. This ist Nostr Unchained's unique differentiator.

**Magic Moment:**
```typescript
// Get entire conversation + state in one query
const conversation = await nostr.query()
  .subgraph(eventId)
  .includeState(['declined', 'accepted'])
  .execute();
```

**Success Metric**: Complex social queries in <3 lines of code

## Advanced Stories - Power User Scenarios

### As a developer building job platforms, I want to track event state changes
**So that** I can show "job declined" or "offer accepted" naturally

**Current Pain**: Multiple queries to check for kind:5 deletion events, manual relationship tracking
**Nostr Unchained**: `const isDeclined = conversation.events.some(e => e.state.declined)`

### As a developer, I want intelligent DM management  
**So that** encrypted messaging feels like normal chat

**Magic Moment:**
```typescript
// Send DM with auto-relay discovery
await nostr.dm.send({
  to: pubkey,
  content: "Hello!",
  // Relays auto-discovered from recipient's NIP-65
});

// Get live conversation updates
const chatStore = nostr.dm.conversation(pubkey);
$: messages = $chatStore;
```

### As a developer, I want profiles and relays combined intelligently
**So that** I don't need to understand Nostr's separate event types

**Current Pain**: kind:0 (profile) and kind:10002 (relays) are separate, manual combination needed
**Nostr Unchained**: `const profile = await nostr.profile.get(pubkey); // Contains profile.relays automatically`

## Onboarding Stories - First-Time Experience

### As a developer new to Nostr, I want zero-config initialization
**So that** I can start building immediately without relay research

```typescript
const nostr = new NostrUnchained(); // Works with sensible defaults
```

### As a frustrated developer, I want clear error messages with solutions
**So that** debugging feels helpful instead of hopeless

**When** relay connection fails: "Relay wss://... unreachable. Trying fallback relays: [...]. Suggestion: Check relay status at relay.info"

### As a developer, I want to understand what's cached and why
**So that** I can optimize performance without guessing

```typescript
const cacheStatus = nostr.cache.status();
// Shows: events count, memory usage, hit rates, suggestions
```

## Integration Stories - SvelteKit Optimization

### As a SvelteKit developer, I want SSR-compatible stores
**So that** my Nostr app works with server-side rendering

### As a developer, I want offline-first caching
**So that** my app works without internet connection

### As a developer, I want automatic query optimization
**So that** I don't accidentally create performance problems

**Smart Subscription Merging**: Multiple `nostr.query().kinds([1])` calls → single relay subscription

## State Management Stories - The "Natural" Feel

### As a developer, I want event state to feel mutable
**So that** Nostr's immutability doesn't complicate my app logic

**Current Pain**: Check for deletion events manually, track state changes across multiple events
**Nostr Unchained**: Events have `.state.deleted`, `.state.declined`, `.state.reactions` properties automatically

### As a developer, I want conversation threading to work automatically
**So that** replies and mentions connect naturally

**Magic**: Event relationships automatically detected and cached, no manual NIP-10 tag parsing

### As a developer, I want relay management to be invisible
**So that** I can focus on features instead of infrastructure

**Auto-Discovery**: User relays loaded from NIP-65, health monitoring, automatic fallbacks
