# Nostr Unchained - Interview Summary

## Problem Statement

**Core Issue**: Bitspark app development stagnated due to cumbersome nostr-tools handling. Current development requires manual management of caching, subscriptions, profile management, DM handling, and relay coordination. Developer reports loss of development enjoyment due to low-level complexity.

**Current Pain Points:**
- Manual event caching and cache invalidation
- Complex subscription management for Svelte reactivity
- Cumbersome relay selection and management
- Low-level event handling without high-level abstractions
- Inefficient extraction of value from Nostr's network effects
- No integrated solution for common patterns (profiles, DMs, queries)

## Target Audience

**Primary**: TypeScript/Svelte developers building modern Nostr applications
**Secondary**: Solo developers using AI-assisted development pipelines
**Technical Level**: Experienced developers wanting high-level abstractions over low-level Nostr primitives

**Key User Persona:**
- Frustrated with nostr-tools complexity
- Building SvelteKit applications
- Wants to focus on app logic, not Nostr infrastructure
- Values development speed and code quality
- Seeking "fun" development experience

## Solution Vision

### Core Value Proposition
**"The new gold standard for Nostr libraries"** - comprehensive, abstract, generically powerful library that makes Nostr development enjoyable and efficient.

### "Wow Moments"
1. **Smart Relay Management**: Always uses correct relays automatically (sender + recipient for DMs, user relays for content)
2. **Effortless Subscriptions**: Clean subscription to cache with efficient Svelte observation
3. **Modern Standard Functions**: Profile fetching/editing, DM handling with best-in-class DX
4. **Complex Queries**: Deep and breadth search utilizing Nostr's network properties with computer science fundamentals

### Developer Experience Goals
- **Magical but Controllable**: Simple defaults, explicit control always available
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Easy for common cases, powerful for complex needs
- **Fail-Silent Philosophy**: Graceful degradation without overwhelming error reporting
- **Information Density**: Maximum utility per line of code

## Scope Boundaries

### Included (All 6 Core Components)
1. **DM Manager**: NIP-17 encryption, conversation management
2. **Query Engine**: Subgraph extraction, graph traversal, complex relationships
3. **Profile Manager**: NIP-01 + NIP-65 integration
4. **Event Builder**: Fluent API, validation, broadcasting
5. **Relay Manager**: Auto-discovery, connection pooling, health monitoring
6. **Cache System**: Unified IndexedDB cache with Store integration

### Explicitly Excluded
- UI Components (Svelte or otherwise)
- App-specific business logic
- Non-essential NIPs beyond core requirements

### Foundation Strategy
- **Built on nostr-tools**: Use as foundation if it improves development without compromising DX
- **Modern Browser Focus**: IndexedDB acceptable, mobile/legacy browser support not critical
- **TypeScript-First**: Complete type safety and excellent IDE support

## Technical Context

### Technology Stack Decisions
- **Cache**: IndexedDB (Dexie.js) primary + In-memory hot layer
- **Crypto**: @noble/secp256k1 + @noble/hashes
- **WebSocket**: ws library for connections
- **Signing**: NIP-07 browser extensions default, private key fallback
- **Foundation**: nostr-tools where beneficial

### SvelteKit Integration Requirements
- **Store Pattern**: Svelte-compatible stores for reactivity
- **No Components**: Pure TypeScript API layer
- **SSR Compatibility**: Not explicitly required
- **Performance**: <50ms cached queries, smooth reactive updates

### Performance Targets
- **Bundle Size**: <150KB gzipped acceptable
- **Query Performance**: <50ms cached, <2s network queries
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for 10k cached events
- **Connection Efficiency**: Max 10 simultaneous relay connections

## Success Criteria

**Primary Metric**: "Getting fun back into Bitspark development"
- Successful Bitspark rewrite using Nostr Unchained
- Reduced development time for common Nostr patterns
- Elimination of manual cache/subscription management
- Smooth integration with AI development pipeline

**Technical Metrics**:  
- Performance targets met consistently
- API usability validated through real development
- Comprehensive coverage of identified use cases

## Research Priorities

### Critical Research Areas
1. **Modern TypeScript Library Patterns 2025**
   - Latest DX best practices for library design
   - Bundle optimization and tree-shaking strategies
   - Modern TypeScript patterns for API design

2. **Nostr Ecosystem Analysis**
   - Comprehensive NDK vs nostr-tools comparison
   - Emerging Nostr patterns and standards
   - Performance optimization opportunities

3. **Cache Strategy Research**
   - IndexedDB performance patterns
   - Reactive system integration approaches
   - Cache invalidation strategies for eventual consistency

4. **SvelteKit Integration Patterns**
   - Store system optimization
   - Performance patterns for large datasets
   - Modern reactive programming approaches

5. **Query Engine Architecture**
   - Graph database query optimization
   - Subgraph extraction algorithms
   - Performance patterns for complex traversals

### Competitive Intelligence Focus
- NDK feature analysis and differentiation opportunities
- nostr-tools limitations and improvement areas  
- Modern library design patterns in similar domains
- Performance benchmarking against existing solutions

## Implementation Context

**Development Approach**: Solo development with AI assistance
**Timeline**: Quality over speed - no fixed deadline pressure
**Distribution**: Lightweight during development, NPM when mature
**Standards**: NIPs to be determined during research phase

**Key Constraint**: Must maintain high information density and correctness throughout development process.
