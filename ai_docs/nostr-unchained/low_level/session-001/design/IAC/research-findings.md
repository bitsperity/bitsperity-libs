# System Design Research Findings

## Research Context
**Architecture Personality**: Adaptive Intelligence - Contextual loading system that intelligently anticipates developer needs
**Key Design Decisions**: Custom crypto implementation, WebSocket library research, Svelte store extension, lazy loading strategies, automatic error recovery
**Research Focus Areas**: Module loading optimization, WebSocket reliability, minimal cryptography, Svelte integration patterns, error recovery mechanisms

## Architecture Pattern Research

### Adaptive Intelligence - Contextual Loading Strategy
**Recommended Pattern**: Dynamic Import with Tree-Shaking Optimization
**Rationale**: Research shows that explicit exports outperform barrel files for tree-shaking, enabling true contextual loading
**Implementation Approach**: 
- Use dynamic `import()` for crypto modules when `dm.with()` is called
- Explicit module exports instead of barrel files to enable optimal tree-shaking
- Module discovery based on usage patterns with intelligent preloading
**TypeScript Considerations**: Modern ES2020+ target supports dynamic imports with proper type inference
**SvelteKit Integration**: SSR-compatible with conditional imports using `browser` check

### Pragmatic Reliability - WebSocket Management
**Recommended Pattern**: Library wrapper with `reconnecting-websocket` + native fallback
**Rationale**: Research identified `reconnecting-websocket` (pladaria) as the most mature solution (1.3k stars, active development)
**Implementation Approach**:
- Primary: `reconnecting-websocket` library for proven reliability
- Fallback: Custom implementation based on `graceful-ws` patterns
- Features: Exponential backoff, connection pooling, health monitoring
**TypeScript Considerations**: Full TypeScript support with reconnecting-websocket
**SvelteKit Integration**: Compatible with both client and server environments

### Lightweight Champion - Custom Crypto Implementation  
**Recommended Pattern**: Minimal ChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation based on `cc2p.js`
**Rationale**: Research found multiple sub-5KB implementations that provide NIP-44 compliance
**Implementation Approach**:
- Core: Custom implementation inspired by `cc2p.js` (pure ES3, ~4KB)
- Fallback: `@noble/ciphers` for maximum compatibility (~20KB)
- Pure JavaScript implementation for universal compatibility
**TypeScript Considerations**: Strong typing for all crypto operations, NIP-44 compliant interfaces
**SvelteKit Integration**: Works in all environments (browser, Node.js, edge)

### Native Svelte Soul - Store Extension Pattern
**Recommended Pattern**: Custom Store implementing Svelte Store Contract
**Rationale**: Research shows multiple successful patterns for extending Svelte stores while maintaining reactivity
**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend `writable()` with custom methods while preserving `subscribe`
- DMConversation implements `Readable<ConversationState>` interface
- Native `$-syntax` support through proper store contract implementation
**TypeScript Considerations**: Generic type parameters for `Readable<T>` extension
**SvelteKit Integration**: SSR-compatible with proper hydration handling

### Smooth Operator - Automatic Error Recovery
**Recommended Pattern**: Exponential backoff with intelligent retry conditions
**Rationale**: Research shows `exponential-backoff` library (12M+ weekly downloads) as industry standard
**Implementation Approach**:
- Use proven exponential backoff patterns for relay switching
- Intelligent retry conditions based on error types (network vs. protocol)
- Automatic relay health monitoring and failover
**TypeScript Considerations**: Type-safe error handling with discriminated union types
**SvelteKit Integration**: Works universally across all SvelteKit environments
