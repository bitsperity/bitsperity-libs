# Requirements Interview Preparation - Subscribe & Query

## Interview Context
**Purpose**: Clarify and validate requirements for Milestone 2 - Subscribe & Query Foundation  
**Stakeholder**: Development team / Product owner  
**Focus Areas**: API design, performance expectations, integration patterns  

## Key Questions to Clarify

### 1. API Design Philosophy
**Question**: How should the Query Builder API balance simplicity vs. power?

**Context**: We need to decide between:
- Simple: `nostr.subscribe({ kinds: [1], limit: 20 })`
- Fluent: `nostr.query().kinds([1]).limit(20).execute()`
- Hybrid: Both patterns supported

**Decision Points**:
- Primary use case: Simple filtering or complex queries?
- Developer experience priority: Discoverability vs. brevity?
- TypeScript integration: How strict should type checking be?

### 2. Reactive Store Integration
**Question**: What level of Svelte integration is required?

**Context**: Multiple approaches possible:
- Basic stores: `readable` with manual subscription management
- Advanced stores: Custom store with lifecycle management
- Full integration: Auto-cleanup, derived stores, actions

**Decision Points**:
- Auto-subscription management vs. manual control?
- Store composition patterns needed?
- Integration with SvelteKit SSR requirements?

### 3. Performance Requirements
**Question**: What are the realistic performance targets?

**Context**: Need to balance:
- Throughput: How many events/second in practice?
- Memory usage: Acceptable limits for event caching?
- Latency: Real-time vs. near-real-time requirements?

**Decision Points**:
- Peak load scenarios and handling strategy?
- Memory management: LRU cache vs. time-based cleanup?
- Performance monitoring and metrics needed?

### 4. Error Handling Strategy
**Question**: How should subscription failures be handled?

**Context**: Multiple failure modes:
- Relay connection lost
- Subscription rejected by relay
- Invalid filter parameters
- Network timeouts

**Decision Points**:
- Automatic retry vs. explicit retry?
- Error reporting to application layer?
- Fallback strategies for relay failures?

### 5. Multi-Relay Behavior
**Question**: How should queries work across multiple relays?

**Context**: Query execution strategies:
- Sequential: Query relays one by one
- Parallel: Query all relays simultaneously  
- Smart: Route queries based on relay capabilities

**Decision Points**:
- Result merging and deduplication strategy?
- Timeout handling for slow relays?
- Relay selection algorithms?

## Technical Clarifications Needed

### A. WebSocket Message Flow
- Should we maintain persistent connections or reconnect per query?
- How to handle EOSE (End of Stored Events) in reactive stores?
- Subscription ID generation strategy (UUIDs vs. sequential)?

### B. Event Caching Strategy
- In-memory cache size limits and eviction policies?
- Persistence layer for offline scenarios?
- Cache invalidation and refresh strategies?

### C. Filter Validation
- Client-side filter validation vs. relay error handling?
- Support for non-standard filter extensions?
- Query optimization for better relay performance?

### D. Type Safety Requirements
- Generic types for event kinds and content?
- Union types for different event structures?
- Runtime type validation vs. compile-time only?

## Use Case Scenarios to Validate

### Scenario 1: Real-time Social Feed
```typescript
// User wants live updates of posts from followed users
const feed = nostr.createFeed()
  .kinds([1])
  .authors(followedUsers)
  .since(Date.now())
  .live(true);

// Should auto-update UI when new posts arrive
$: posts = $feed.events.slice(0, 20);
```

**Questions**:
- How to handle high-volume feeds (100+ posts/minute)?
- Memory management for infinite scroll scenarios?
- Real-time vs. batched updates for UI performance?

### Scenario 2: Historical Data Query
```typescript
// User wants to load conversation history
const history = await nostr.query()
  .kinds([1])
  .tags('e', ['thread-root-id'])
  .until(Date.now())
  .limit(100)
  .execute();
```

**Questions**:
- Should this create a subscription or one-time query?
- How to handle large result sets (pagination)?
- Caching strategy for repeated queries?

### Scenario 3: Complex Filtering
```typescript
// User wants posts mentioning specific topics
const topicPosts = await nostr.query()
  .kinds([1])
  .tags('t', ['bitcoin', 'nostr'])
  .since(Date.now() - 86400000) // Last 24h
  .authors(trustedUsers)
  .execute();
```

**Questions**:
- AND vs. OR logic for multiple tag filters?
- Support for text content filtering?
- Performance implications of complex filters?

### Scenario 4: Multi-Relay Aggregation
```typescript
// User wants comprehensive results from multiple relays
const globalFeed = await nostr.query()
  .kinds([1])
  .limit(50)
  .relays(['relay1', 'relay2', 'relay3'])
  .execute();
```

**Questions**:
- Result merging and duplicate detection?
- Timeout handling for slow relays?
- Quality ranking of results from different relays?

## Technical Constraints to Confirm

### C1. Backward Compatibility
- Must not break existing publishing functionality
- Should integrate seamlessly with current RelayManager
- Preserve all Milestone 1 test coverage

### C2. Resource Limits
- Maximum number of concurrent subscriptions?
- Memory limits for event caching?
- CPU usage constraints for filtering operations?

### C3. Development Environment
- Local relay support requirements (`ws://umbrel.local:4848`)
- Test environment setup needs?
- Browser vs. Node.js compatibility requirements?

## Questions for Stakeholder Review

1. **Priority**: Which is more important - simple API or powerful querying?
2. **Performance**: Are the 100 events/second targets realistic for our use cases?
3. **Integration**: How important is tight Svelte integration vs. framework agnostic?
4. **Reliability**: Should we prioritize consistency or availability in multi-relay scenarios?
5. **Timeline**: Any specific deadlines or demo requirements for Milestone 2?

## Follow-up Actions After Interview
1. Document final requirements specification
2. Create API contract definitions
3. Plan implementation phases with TDD approach
4. Set up comprehensive test scenarios
5. Define success metrics and validation criteria
