# Requirements Analysis Summary - Milestone 2: Subscribe & Query

## Analysis Context
**Session**: 2  
**Milestone**: 2 - Subscribe & Query Foundation  
**Previous Milestone**: 1 - Basic Publishing (71% test coverage, core publishing working)  
**Analysis Date**: 2025-01-20  

## Core Problem Statement
**Current State**: We have solid publishing foundation (29/41 tests passing) but lack the subscription and query capabilities that make Nostr truly powerful.

**Target State**: Complete publish/subscribe foundation with SQL-like query capabilities that feel natural to developers coming from traditional databases.

## High-Level Requirements Categories

### 1. NIP-01 Subscription Protocol (Critical)
**Priority**: P0 - Must Have
- Complete WebSocket REQ/EVENT/EOSE/CLOSE message flow
- All NIP-01 filter types: `ids`, `authors`, `kinds`, `since`, `until`, `limit`
- Proper subscription lifecycle management
- Multiple concurrent subscriptions support

### 2. Query Builder API (Core Value Proposition)
**Priority**: P0 - Must Have  
- SQL-like fluent interface for event queries
- Method chaining for filter composition
- Type-safe filter construction
- Intuitive API that reads like natural language

### 3. Reactive Store System (Developer Experience)
**Priority**: P0 - Must Have
- Svelte-compatible reactive stores
- Real-time event updates
- Automatic subscription management
- Memory-efficient event caching

### 4. Performance & Scalability (Quality)
**Priority**: P1 - Should Have
- Handle 100+ events/second
- Efficient memory usage for large event sets
- Automatic cleanup and leak prevention
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### 5. Error Handling & Reliability (Production Readiness)
**Priority**: P1 - Should Have
- Graceful degradation on relay failures
- Retry mechanisms for failed subscriptions
- Clear error messages and recovery guidance
- Connection state management

## Detailed Functional Requirements

### FR-1: WebSocket Subscription Management
```typescript
// Must support this usage pattern:
const subscription = await nostr.subscribe({
  kinds: [1],
  authors: ['npub1234...'],
  limit: 20
});

// Auto-cleanup when subscription is no longer needed
subscription.close();
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- REQ message construction and sending
- EVENT message parsing and validation  
- EOSE (End of Stored Events) handling
- CLOSE message support for subscription cleanup
- Subscription ID generation and tracking

### FR-2: Query Builder Pattern
```typescript
// Must support fluent API:
const posts = await nostr.query()
  .kinds([1])
  .authors(['npub1234...', 'npub5678...'])
  .since(Date.now() - 86400000) // Last 24 hours
  .limit(50)
  .execute();

// Advanced filtering:
const replies = await nostr.query()
  .kinds([1])
  .tags('e', ['event123...'])
  .until(Date.now())
  .execute();
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- Builder pattern implementation with method chaining
- Type-safe filter validation
- NIP-01 filter object generation
- Query execution with multiple relay support
- Result aggregation and deduplication

### FR-3: Reactive Store Integration
```typescript
// Must support Svelte reactive patterns:
const postStore = nostr.createFeed()
  .kinds([1])
  .live(true);

$: console.log('Live posts:', $postStore.events);
$: console.log('Connection status:', $postStore.status);

// Store should auto-update when new events arrive
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- Svelte store interface compatibility
- Live subscription management
- Event deduplication and sorting
- Connection state tracking
- Automatic subscription cleanup on store destruction

### FR-4: Event Filtering & Validation
```typescript
// Must properly filter events according to NIP-01:
const filters = {
  kinds: [1, 6], // Text notes and reposts
  authors: ['pub1...', 'pub2...'],
  since: 1704067200, // Unix timestamp
  until: 1704153600,
  limit: 100,
  '#e': ['event1...', 'event2...'], // Tag filters
  '#p': ['pub3...'] // P-tag filters
};
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- All NIP-01 filter type support
- Client-side filter validation
- Server-side filter compliance checking
- Filter optimization for performance

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- **Throughput**: Handle 100+ events/second per subscription
- **Latency**: <100ms from event received to store updated
- **Memory**: <5MB per 1000 cached events
- **CPU**: <10% CPU usage during normal operation

### NFR-2: Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.9% subscription uptime
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Data Integrity**: No event loss or duplication
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with available relays if some fail

### NFR-3: Developer Experience
- **API Discoverability**: IntelliSense support for all methods
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented with examples
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and inference

## Technical Constraints

### TC-1: Existing Architecture Compatibility
- Must work with existing RelayManager from Milestone 1
- Preserve current publishing functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing tests
- Use established crypto and signing patterns

### TC-2: WebSocket Protocol Compliance
- Full NIP-01 message format compliance
- Proper subscription ID management
- Handle all standard relay response types
- Support multiple concurrent subscriptions per connection

### TC-3: Browser & Node.js Compatibility
- Work in both browser and Node.js environments
- Use existing WebSocket compatibility layer
- Maintain current build/bundle configuration
- No new dependencies unless critical

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **All NIP-01 subscription features working**: REQ/EVENT/EOSE/CLOSE flow
2. **Query Builder API functional**: All filter types with fluent interface
3. **Reactive stores operational**: Real-time updates in Svelte components
4. **Performance targets met**: 100+ events/second handling
5. **Test coverage >90%**: Comprehensive test suite for all features

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Memory stability**: No leaks during long-running subscriptions
2. **Error handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery
3. **Multi-relay support**: Concurrent subscriptions across relays
4. **Local relay compatibility**: Full functionality with `ws://umbrel.local:4848`

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Milestone 1 completion**: Publishing foundation must be stable
- **WebSocket infrastructure**: RelayManager working correctly
- **Crypto foundations**: Event validation and ID calculation
- **Test infrastructure**: Vitest environment operational

### Assumptions
- **Relay behavior**: Standard NIP-01 compliant relays

- **Browser support**: Modern ES2020+ browser environments
- **Development environment**: Local test relay available

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **WebSocket subscription complexity**: Managing multiple concurrent subscriptions
- **Memory management**: Preventing leaks in long-running subscriptions
- **Event ordering**: Handling out-of-order event delivery

### Medium Risk
- **Relay compatibility**: Different relay implementations
- **Performance optimization**: Meeting throughput requirements
- **Error recovery**: Handling various failure scenarios

### Low Risk
- **API design**: Building on proven patterns from Milestone 1
- **TypeScript integration**: Extending existing type system
- **Test implementation**: Using established testing patterns

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed technical specifications
2. Design API contracts and interfaces
3. Plan implementation phases with TDD approach
4. Set up comprehensive test scenarios
