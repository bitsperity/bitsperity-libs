# System Design Interview Preparation - Subscribe & Query Architecture

## Interview Context
**Purpose**: Validate system design decisions for Milestone 2 - Subscribe & Query Foundation  
**Stakeholders**: Development team, Architecture reviewers  
**Focus Areas**: Component design, performance architecture, integration strategy  

## Architecture Validation Questions

### 1. Component Architecture Decisions

#### Q1.1: Subscription Manager as Central Coordinator
**Proposal**: Single SubscriptionManager coordinates all subscriptions across multiple relays

**Validation Questions**:
- Is centralized subscription management the right approach vs. distributed?
- How do we handle subscription manager becoming a bottleneck?
- Should each relay have its own subscription manager?
- What happens if the central manager fails or needs restart?

**Alternative Approaches**:
- **Distributed**: Each relay manages its own subscriptions
- **Hybrid**: Local managers with central coordinator
- **Actor Model**: Each subscription as independent actor

#### Q1.2: Three-Layer Store Architecture
**Proposal**: Data Layer → Reactive Layer → UI Layer separation

**Validation Questions**:
- Is three layers appropriate or over-engineered for this use case?
- How do we ensure performance isn't degraded by layer boundaries?
- Should stores directly manage their subscriptions for better performance?
- How do we handle cross-layer error propagation efficiently?

**Performance Concerns**:
- Event flow latency through multiple layers
- Memory overhead of layer abstractions
- Debugging complexity with multiple layers

### 2. Performance Architecture Validation

#### Q2.1: Event Caching Strategy
**Proposal**: LRU + Time-based eviction with 10k event limit

**Validation Questions**:
- Is 10k events the right default limit for various use cases?
- Should cache size be configurable per store or global?
- How do we handle memory pressure from the OS?
- Should we implement cache compression for older events?

**Alternative Strategies**:
- **Priority-based**: Cache important events longer
- **Usage-based**: Cache frequently accessed events
- **Hybrid**: Combination of time, usage, and size limits

#### Q2.2: Batched Store Updates
**Proposal**: 16ms batching for ~60fps UI updates

**Validation Questions**:
- Is 16ms the right batch interval for all scenarios?
- Should batching be configurable per store?
- How do we handle time-critical updates that need immediate processing?
- What's the impact on memory usage during high-volume periods?

**Edge Cases**:
- Real-time trading applications needing <1ms updates
- Low-frequency updates where batching adds unnecessary latency
- High-volume scenarios where 16ms batches become too large

### 3. Multi-Relay Architecture Decisions

#### Q3.1: Relay Selection Strategy
**Proposal**: Score-based relay selection with capability detection

**Validation Questions**:
- How do we handle relays with different capabilities (NIP support)?
- Should we query all relays simultaneously or use priority ordering?
- How do we balance load vs. result completeness?
- What's the strategy for handling relay-specific optimizations?

**Performance Trade-offs**:
- **Parallel queries**: Better completeness, higher resource usage
- **Sequential queries**: Lower resource usage, potential timeouts
- **Adaptive**: Smart routing based on query type and relay performance

#### Q3.2: Result Aggregation Strategy
**Proposal**: Event deduplication with timestamp-based ordering

**Validation Questions**:
- How do we handle events with identical content but different IDs?
- Should we trust relay timestamps or use local receipt time?
- How do we handle clock skew between relays?
- What's the strategy for handling conflicting event versions?

**Complexity Concerns**:
- Different relays returning events in different orders
- Network latency affecting result aggregation timing
- Memory usage for maintaining deduplication state

### 4. Integration Architecture Validation

#### Q4.1: RelayManager Extension Strategy
**Proposal**: Extend existing RelayManager without breaking changes

**Validation Questions**:
- Is extending RelayManager the cleanest approach vs. composition?
- How do we ensure subscription features don't impact publishing performance?
- Should we create a separate SubscriptionRelayManager?
- How do we handle version compatibility during development?

**Architectural Alternatives**:
- **Composition**: SubscriptionManager uses RelayManager as dependency
- **Inheritance**: SubscriptionRelayManager extends RelayManager
- **Delegation**: Shared connection pool with separate message routing

#### Q4.2: Event Processing Pipeline Integration
**Proposal**: Unified event processing for publish and subscription flows

**Validation Questions**:
- Should event processing be unified or separate for different flows?
- How do we ensure subscription events don't interfere with publishing?
- What's the performance impact of unified processing?
- How do we handle different validation requirements?

**Processing Concerns**:
- Different performance requirements for publish vs. subscription
- Potential coupling between independent features
- Debugging complexity with shared processing

### 5. Developer Experience Architecture

#### Q5.1: Query Builder API Design
**Proposal**: Immutable builder pattern with method chaining

**Validation Questions**:
- Is immutability worth the memory overhead for query building?
- Should we provide both mutable and immutable APIs?
- How do we handle complex query scenarios with many filters?
- What's the learning curve for developers unfamiliar with builder patterns?

**API Alternatives**:
- **Object-based**: `query({ kinds: [1], authors: [...] })`
- **Mutable builder**: Modify builder instance instead of creating new ones
- **Functional**: `compose(kinds([1]), authors([...]))`

#### Q5.2: Store Factory Pattern
**Proposal**: Factory functions with fluent configuration

**Validation Questions**:
- Is the factory pattern intuitive for Svelte developers?
- Should we support direct constructor usage for advanced users?
- How do we handle store configuration validation?
- What's the performance impact of factory abstraction?

**Usability Concerns**:
- Discoverability of available options
- Error handling for invalid configurations
- TypeScript inference complexity

### 6. Error Handling Architecture

#### Q6.1: Hierarchical Error Handling Strategy
**Proposal**: Different error types with different recovery strategies

**Validation Questions**:
- Is the error hierarchy appropriate for all subscription scenarios?
- How do we ensure errors are propagated to the right level?
- Should error recovery be automatic or require user intervention?
- How do we handle cascading failures across multiple relays?

**Error Scenarios**:
- Network failures: automatic retry vs. immediate failure
- Protocol errors: log and continue vs. stop subscription
- Resource exhaustion: graceful degradation vs. complete failure

#### Q6.2: Store Error State Management
**Proposal**: Explicit error states in stores with recovery actions

**Validation Questions**:
- Should error state be part of the main store or separate?
- How do we handle partial failures in multi-relay scenarios?
- What's the right granularity for error reporting?
- Should error recovery be automatic or manual?

**Implementation Challenges**:
- Error state synchronization across stores
- User experience for error recovery
- Debugging support for complex error scenarios
