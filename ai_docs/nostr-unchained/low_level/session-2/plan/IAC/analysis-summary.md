## Implementation Phase Strategy

### Phase Sequencing Analysis
```
Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
├── Basic Subscription Engine
├── Simple Query Builder Core
├── Basic Store Interface
└── Event Cache Foundation

Phase 2: Integration (Days 4-6)  
├── Multi-Relay Coordination
├── Advanced Query Features
├── Reactive Store Implementation
└── Performance Optimization

Phase 3: Polish & Quality (Days 7-10)
├── Error Handling & Recovery
├── Memory Management
├── Performance Tuning
└── Comprehensive Testing
```

**Rationale for Sequencing**:
1. **Foundation First**: Core components before integration complexity
2. **Horizontal Integration**: All components working together before optimization
3. **Quality Focus**: Dedicated time for performance and reliability
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Most complex parts (multi-relay) in middle phases

### Dependency Analysis
```
Critical Path Dependencies:
SubscriptionManager → QueryBuilder → NostrStore
     ↓                    ↓             ↓
RelayManager        FilterEngine   EventCache
(from M1)           (new)          (new)
```

**Dependency Management Strategy**:
- **Mock Dependencies Early**: Use mocks for rapid TDD cycles
- **Integration Points**: Clear interfaces between components
- **Parallel Development**: Independent components developed concurrently
- **Progressive Integration**: Gradual replacement of mocks with real implementations

## Test-Driven Implementation Planning

```
Each Component TDD Cycle (2-3 days):
Day 1: RED - Comprehensive test suite design
├── API contract tests
├── Error scenario tests  
├── Performance requirement tests
└── Integration point tests

Day 2: GREEN - Minimal implementation
├── Pass all RED tests with simplest code
├── Focus on correctness over optimization
├── Document assumptions and limitations
└── Ensure clean test suite

Day 3: REFACTOR - Optimization and enhancement
├── Performance optimization
├── Code quality improvements
├── Advanced feature implementation
└── Documentation updates
```

### Test Infrastructure Planning
```typescript
// Test infrastructure requirements per component
interface TestInfrastructure {
  SubscriptionManager: {
    mocks: ['WebSocket', 'RelayManager', 'EventCache'],
    fixtures: ['Test events', 'Relay responses', 'Error scenarios'],
    performance: ['High-volume event simulation', 'Memory usage tracking'],

  },
  
  EventCache: {
    mocks: ['None - pure data structure'],
    fixtures: ['Large event sets', 'Query patterns'],
    performance: ['Cache hit rates', 'Memory efficiency', 'Eviction performance'],
    integration: ['Cache coordination with other components']
  }
}
```

## Risk-Based Planning

### High-Risk Implementation Areas
1. **WebSocket Subscription State Management**
   - **Risk**: Race conditions, memory leaks, connection state synchronization
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive mocking, state machine implementation, thorough testing
   - **TDD Focus**: State transition tests, concurrent operation tests

2. **Multi-Relay Result Aggregation**
   - **Risk**: Duplicate events, ordering issues, partial failures
   - **Mitigation**: Deterministic event ordering, robust deduplication
   - **TDD Focus**: Result merging tests, failure scenario tests

3. **Memory Management in Long-Running Subscriptions**
   - **Risk**: Memory leaks, excessive memory usage, performance degradation
   - **Mitigation**: Reference counting, automated cleanup, monitoring
   - **TDD Focus**: Memory leak tests, cleanup verification tests

4. **Real-Time Performance Under Load**
   - **Risk**: UI blocking, memory pressure, degraded responsiveness
   - **Mitigation**: Event batching, performance monitoring, load testing
   - **TDD Focus**: Performance benchmark tests, stress testing

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

  }
}
```

## Performance-Driven Planning

### Performance Implementation Strategy
```typescript
// Performance targets integrated into TDD cycles
interface PerformanceTargets {
  subscriptionCreation: {
    target: '<100ms',
    testApproach: 'Benchmark test in RED phase',
    implementation: 'Optimize during REFACTOR phase',
    validation: 'Continuous performance monitoring'
  },
  
  eventProcessing: {
    target: '>100 events/second',
    testApproach: 'Load testing with event generators',
    implementation: 'Batching and efficient data structures',
    validation: 'Stress testing with real event volumes'
  },
  
  memoryUsage: {
    target: '<5MB per 1000 events',
    testApproach: 'Memory monitoring during tests',
    implementation: 'Efficient caching and cleanup',
    validation: 'Long-running memory leak tests'
  }
}
```

### Performance Testing Integration
```typescript
// Performance tests as first-class citizens in TDD
describe('SubscriptionManager Performance TDD', () => {
  // RED: Performance requirement test
  test('should create subscription in <100ms', async () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    const subscription = await manager.subscribe([{ kinds: [1] }]);
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100);
    await subscription.close();
  });
  
  // GREEN: Simple implementation to pass
  // REFACTOR: Optimize for performance target
});
```

    });
  });
  
  // Phase 3: Full system integration
  describe('Full System Integration', () => {
    test('Complete subscription workflow', async () => {
      const nostr = new NostrUnchained();
      const store = createFeed().kinds([1]);
      
      // End-to-end test with real components
    });
  });
});
```
