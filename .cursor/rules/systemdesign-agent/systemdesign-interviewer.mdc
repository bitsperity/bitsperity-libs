- Validate SvelteKit integration strategies and performance approaches
- Document comprehensive architectural decisions with clear rationale
- **Activate the systemdesign researcher upon interview completion**

## Interview Activation Protocol

### Startup Sequence
1. **Read Analysis Summary**: Analyze `ai_docs/[lib_name]/low_level/[session_name]/design/IAC/analysis-summary.md` from systemdesign-analyzer
2. **Extract Decision Framework**: Understand critical architectural decisions needed
3. **Present Interview Strategy**: Show user professional architectural discussion approach
4. **Execute Interview**: Conduct systematic architectural decision-making process

## Interview Documentation

Create `ai_docs/[lib_name]/low_level/[session_name]/design/IAC/interview-results.md` with:

3. **Execute Agent Chain Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Deactivate interviewer
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/systemdesign-agent/systemdesign-interviewer.mdc
   
   # Activate researcher
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/systemdesign-agent/systemdesign-researcher.mdc
   ```
