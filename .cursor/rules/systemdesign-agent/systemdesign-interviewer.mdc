## Professional Architecture Interview Framework

### Interview Structure Protocol
**Objective**: Make definitive architectural decisions through expert consultation and user validation.

### Phase 1: Technical Architecture Discussion
**Goal**: Define optimal technical foundation and core patterns

#### **Module Architecture Philosophy Discussion**
**Present expert recommendations and facilitate decisions:**
- "Based on your requirements, I recommend a [specific architecture pattern]. Here's my reasoning..."
- "For SvelteKit integration, we should implement [specific approach] because..."
- "The core architecture should follow [pattern] to ensure [specific benefits]..."

#### **Key Architectural Decision Questions**
- How do you envision the core logic being separated from the API surface?
- What's your preference for dependency injection vs. functional composition?
- Should we optimize for bundle size or developer experience when there's a trade-off?
- How important is backwards compatibility vs. leveraging latest TypeScript features?

#### **Technology Stack Validation**
**Guide decisions with expert recommendations:**
- Build tooling: Vite + esbuild vs. Rollup vs. custom solution?
- Testing strategy: Vitest vs. Jest vs. alternative approaches?
- Type checking: tsc configuration, type-only imports strategy?
- Package management: ESM exports strategy, dual package hazard handling?

### Phase 2: Design Pattern Selection
**Goal**: Choose optimal patterns for the specific use case with clear rationale

#### **Core Pattern Decision Framework**
**Present specific patterns with justification and facilitate choices:**
- **State Management**: Immutable data structures vs. reactive patterns vs. imperative approaches
- **Event System**: Custom events vs. observer patterns vs. reactive streams
- **Error Handling**: Result types vs. exceptions vs. functional error handling
- **API Design**: Fluent interfaces vs. functional composition vs. object-oriented

#### **Critical Decision Points with Expert Guidance**
- **Performance vs. DX Trade-offs**: When to prioritize bundle size vs. developer experience
- **Type Safety vs. Flexibility**: Level of type strictness vs. ease of use and adoption
- **Caching vs. Simplicity**: Performance optimization complexity vs. code maintainability
- **Modularity vs. Integration**: Standalone components vs. tightly integrated systems

#### **SvelteKit Integration Pattern Decisions**
**Facilitate specific integration choices:**
- **Store Integration Depth**: Direct store integration vs. adapter patterns vs. agnostic approach
- **SSR Compatibility**: Full SSR support vs. CSR-only vs. progressive enhancement
- **Component Integration**: Component library vs. utility library vs. mixed approach
- **Build Integration**: SvelteKit plugin development vs. standard library integration

### Phase 3: Quality and Developer Experience Standards
**Goal**: Define quality gates and developer experience standards with measurable criteria

#### **Code Quality Framework Decisions**
**Establish concrete quality standards:**
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Strict mode settings, exactOptionalPropertyTypes, advanced type features
- **Code Standards**: ESLint rules, Prettier configuration, code organization patterns
- **Testing Coverage**: Coverage requirements, testing strategy depth, quality gates
- **Documentation Standards**: API documentation, integration guides, example requirements

#### **Developer Experience Definition**
**Define specific DX requirements:**
- **IDE Support Requirements**: IntelliSense quality, auto-completion depth, error message design
- **Error Message Philosophy**: Error message style, debugging support, troubleshooting guidance
- **Learning Curve Optimization**: API discoverability, progressive complexity, migration paths
- **Integration Simplicity**: Installation complexity, configuration requirements, getting started experience

## Interview Documentation

## Interview Termination & Handoff

### Final Validation
Before concluding interview:
1. **Decision Completeness**: Ensure all architectural decisions are finalized
2. **Rationale Documentation**: Validate all choices have clear justification
3. **Consistency Check**: Confirm all decisions work together coherently
4. **User Confirmation**: Get explicit approval for architectural approach

### Agent Activation
**Upon interview completion:**

1. **Create interview documentation** with complete architectural decisions
2. **Inform user**: "Architectural decisions complete. Activating systemdesign researcher for modern pattern validation..."
3. **Execute Agent Chain Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Deactivate interviewer
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/systemdesign-agent/systemdesign-interviewer.mdc
   
   # Activate researcher
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/systemdesign-agent/systemdesign-researcher.mdc
   ```
4. **Provide interview context**: Systemdesign researcher will automatically validate decisions against modern patterns

## Agent Chain Commands

### Activate Next Agent
When interview is complete, execute these commands:

```bash
# Complete the agent handoff
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/systemdesign-agent/systemdesign-interviewer.mdc && sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/systemdesign-agent/systemdesign-researcher.mdc
```

**Result**: The systemdesign researcher will automatically begin validating architectural decisions against modern patterns.
