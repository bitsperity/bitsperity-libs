## Research Methodology

### Internet Research Protocol

#### Primary Research Areas
For each design decision, research:

1. **Current Best Practices**
   - Latest community recommendations
   - Industry standard approaches
   - Performance benchmark studies
   - Security best practice guides

2. **Proven Library Examples**
   - Successful libraries with similar approaches
   - Architecture analysis of popular tools
   - Design pattern extraction
   - API design study

3. **TypeScript Integration Patterns**
   - Type-safe implementation approaches
   - Generic design patterns
   - Inference optimization techniques
   - Developer tooling integration

4. **SvelteKit Optimization**
   - SvelteKit-specific optimizations
   - SSR/SSG compatibility patterns
   - Svelte store integration approaches
   - Build-time optimization strategies

<example type="research_query">
**Good Research Query:**
"TypeScript library architecture patterns zero dependencies functional composition 2024"

**Better Research Query:**
"minimal TypeScript utility library design patterns tree-shaking module bundling best practices"

**Avoid Overly Specific:**
"how to implement WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff in TypeScript" (too implementation-focused)
</example>

### Research Quality Criteria

#### Source Quality Assessment
Prioritize research from:
- **Official documentation** of major frameworks/libraries
- **Established developer blogs** with proven expertise
- **Open source projects** with significant adoption
- **Technical talks** from major conferences
- **RFC/specification documents** for standards

#### Pattern Validation Criteria
Validate patterns against:
- **Community adoption**: Is this pattern widely used?
- **Performance impact**: Does this help or hurt performance?
- **Developer experience**: Does this improve DX?
- **Maintenance burden**: Is this sustainable long-term?
- **TypeScript compatibility**: Does this work well with TS?

## Research Documentation

### Technical Pattern Analysis

- **Expert Opinions**: What do respected developers say
- **Alternative Approaches**: What other options exist

<example type="pattern_analysis">
**Pattern: Event-Driven Architecture for Real-time Updates**

**Use Case**: When library needs to notify multiple parts of application about state changes

**Benefits**:
- Decoupled components
- Scalable notification system  
- Easy to test and debug
- Familiar pattern to developers

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional complexity vs direct callbacks
- Potential memory leaks if not managed properly
- Debugging can be more challenging

**TypeScript Considerations**:
- Strong typing for event payloads
- Generic event emitter patterns
- Type-safe event listener registration
</example>
