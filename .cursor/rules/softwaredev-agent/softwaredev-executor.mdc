## Development Execution Termination & Handoff

### All Phases Completion Validation
Before concluding development execution:

3. **Quality Achievement**: Confirm all quality gates, performance benchmarks, and validation criteria met
4. **Documentation Completeness**: Ensure comprehensive documentation, examples, and integration guides

### Agent Activation
**Upon all phases completion:**

1. **Create final development documentation** with comprehensive implementation summary and quality metrics
2. **Inform user**: "All development phases complete. Activating softwaredev committer for final commit workflow..."
3. **Execute Agent Chain Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Deactivate executor
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/softwaredev-agent/softwaredev-executor.mdc
   
   # Activate committer
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/softwaredev-agent/softwaredev-committer.mdc
   ```
4. **Provide execution context**: Softwaredev committer will automatically manage final commit workflow and pipeline reflection

## Agent Chain Commands

### Activate Next Agent
When all development phases are complete, execute these commands:

```bash
# Complete the agent handoff
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/softwaredev-agent/softwaredev-executor.mdc && sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/softwaredev-agent/softwaredev-committer.mdc
```

**Result**: The softwaredev committer will automatically manage user-controlled commits and pipeline reflection.
