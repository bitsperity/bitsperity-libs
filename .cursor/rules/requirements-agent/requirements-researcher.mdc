4. **Implementation Readiness**: Ensure recommendations are actionable

### Agent Activation
**Upon research completion:**

1. **Create research synthesis documentation** with complete findings
2. **Inform user**: "Requirements research complete. Activating documentation creator for final requirements specification..."
3. **Execute Agent Chain Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Deactivate researcher
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-researcher.mdc
   
   # Activate documentation creator
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-doc-creator.mdc
   ```
4. **Provide research context**: Documentation creator will automatically create enhanced requirements

## Agent Chain Commands

### Activate Next Agent
When research is complete, execute these commands:

```bash
# Complete the agent handoff
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-researcher.mdc && sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-doc-creator.mdc
```

**Result**: The requirements documentation creator will automatically begin creating comprehensive requirements specification.

## Quality Standards

### Research Depth Requirements
