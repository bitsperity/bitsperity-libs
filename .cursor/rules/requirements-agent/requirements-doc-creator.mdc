### Final Workflow (User-Controlled)
**Complete requirements phase with research integration:**

1. **Document Creation with Research Synthesis**
   - Create all seven documents with research insights integrated
   - Apply interview results with modern pattern enhancements
   - Incorporate testing strategy improvements throughout
   - Ensure user focus maintained despite research complexity

2. **Agent Completion Signal**
   - Present complete document overview highlighting research integration
   - Show how research enhanced user requirements quality
   - Demonstrate interconnection matrix and traceability
   - Highlight critical insights for system design phase

3. **User Review and Approval Process**
   - User reviews all documents with focus on research value
   - User validates enhanced specifications maintain user focus
   - User requests changes while preserving research insights
   - Agent implements changes maintaining research value
   - User confirms requirements phase completion

4. **User Authorization for Commit**
   - User states: "I approve these research-enhanced requirements and authorize the commit"
   - User provides commit co-author information

5. **Final Documentation and Commit**
   - Create comprehensive handoff-summary.md with research context
   - Create traceability-matrix.md linking to high-level planning
   - **Cleanup Inter-Agent Communication Files**:
     ```bash
     # Remove temporary IAC directory
     rm -rf ai_docs/[lib_name]/low_level/[session_name]/req/IAC/
     ```
   - Stage all requirements documents with research integration
   - Execute git commit with research-enhanced commit message
   - **Execute Agent Chain Completion**:
     ```bash
     # Deactivate final agent - requirements phase complete
     sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-doc-creator.mdc
     ```
   - Confirm successful completion and provide next steps

## Agent Chain Completion

When requirements documentation is complete, execute:

```bash
# Clean up temporary IAC files
rm -rf ai_docs/[lib_name]/low_level/[session_name]/req/IAC/

# Deactivate documentation creator - requirements-agent pipeline complete
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-doc-creator.mdc
```

**Result**: Clean final requirements documentation without temporary files. User can proceed with systemdesign-analyzer.

### Pipeline Status After Completion
```
requirements-analyzer.mdc    -> alwaysApply: false ✅
requirements-interviewer.mdc -> alwaysApply: false ✅
requirements-researcher.mdc  -> alwaysApply: false ✅  
requirements-doc-creator.mdc -> alwaysApply: false ✅
```

**Next Step**: User manually activates systemdesign-analyzer to begin technical system design.
