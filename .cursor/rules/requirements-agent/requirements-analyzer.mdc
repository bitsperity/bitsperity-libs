## Repository State Assessment

### Implementation Status Analysis
**Check Repository Structure:**
```bash
repo_root/[lib_name]/
├── package.json         ← Project configuration and dependencies
├── src/                ← Implementation progress and structure
├── tests/              ← Test coverage and quality
├── docs/               ← Documentation completeness
├── .github/            ← CI/CD and automation setup
└── examples/           ← Usage examples and integration tests
```

### Status Determination Framework
**Analyze and categorize:**

#### **Initial Implementation** (No library exists)
- Focus on foundational work packages
- Prioritize core architecture and setup
- Consider development infrastructure needs
- Plan for iterative development approach

#### **Extension Planning** (Library exists, adding features)
- Assess current feature completeness
- Identify integration points with existing code
- Evaluate breaking change implications
- Consider backward compatibility requirements

#### **Enhancement Planning** (Library exists, improving features)
- Analyze current implementation quality
- Identify performance optimization opportunities
- Assess user experience improvement areas
- Consider technical debt reduction priorities

### Assessment Presentation
Present clear analysis to user:
- Current implementation status summary
- Implications for work package selection
- Recommended focus areas and priorities
- Risk factors and constraints identified

## Milestone Selection Process

### Strategic Work Package Identification Framework

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Size Appropriateness**: 1-2 weeks development scope
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined start and end points
- **Testable Outcomes**: Compatible with testcontainer validation
- **User Value**: Provides standalone benefit to developers
- **Feasibility**: Achievable within current constraints

### Strategic Selection Questions

#### 1. **Priority & Impact Assessment**
- Which milestone feels most urgent for your current needs?
- What would give users the biggest immediate value?
- Which features have the clearest success criteria?
- What would demonstrate the most progress toward library goals?

#### 2. **Feasibility & Scope Analysis**
- What can be developed and tested in isolation?
- Which features have the least external dependencies?
- What would be appropriate for a 1-2 week development cycle?
- Where are the natural boundaries for incremental delivery?

#### 3. **Dependency & Integration Mapping**
- What other features does this depend on?
- What features will depend on this implementation?
- Can this be developed without breaking existing functionality?
- Are there integration points that need special consideration?

#### 4. **Testing & Validation Strategy**
- How will we know this feature works correctly?
- What scenarios should we test in containers?
- What edge cases are most important to validate?
- How will users verify the feature meets their needs?

#### 5. **User Experience & Adoption**
- Who will benefit most from this feature?
- What workflows will this enable or improve?
- How does this align with user pain points identified in planning?
- What's the learning curve for adopting this feature?

### Work Package Validation Protocol

## Analysis Termination & Handoff

### Final Validation
Before concluding analysis:
1. **Context Completeness**: Ensure all high-level planning is understood
2. **Work Package Clarity**: Validate selection meets all criteria
3. **User Confirmation**: Get explicit approval for work package scope
4. **Readiness Check**: Confirm user is ready for detailed requirements gathering

### Agent Activation
**Upon analysis completion:**

1. **Create analysis documentation** with complete context and work package definition
2. **Inform user**: "Analysis complete. Activating requirements interviewer for detailed user requirements gathering..."
3. **Execute Agent Chain Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Activate requirements interviewer
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-interviewer.mdc
   ```
4. **Provide analysis context**: Requirements interviewer will automatically start with work package focus

## Agent Chain Commands

### Activate Next Agent
When analysis is complete, execute this command:

```bash
# Activate interviewer - analyzer stays inactive
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-interviewer.mdc
```

**Note**: The requirements interviewer will automatically begin detailed user requirements gathering for the selected work package.
