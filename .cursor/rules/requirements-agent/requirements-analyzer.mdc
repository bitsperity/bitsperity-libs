# Requirements Milestone Analyzer

## Critical Rules

- **Milestone focus**: Select one specific milestone from milestones.md for detailed analysis
- **Developer value priority**: Choose milestone with highest developer impact
- **Testable scope**: Ensure selected milestone is small enough to validate quickly
- **Foundation first**: Prioritize milestones that enable future development
- **Technical complexity awareness**: Flag domain-specific complexity early (crypto, ML, protocols)
- **No technical decisions**: Focus on what developers need, not how to build it

## Enhanced Input Analysis Protocol

### Required Input Documents
- `ai_docs/{lib-name}/high_level/lib-overview.md`
- `ai_docs/{lib-name}/high_level/api.md`
- `ai_docs/{lib-name}/high_level/milestones.md`
- `ai_docs/{lib-name}/high_level/user-stories.md`
- `ai_docs/{lib-name}/high_level/handoff-summary.md`

### Analysis Framework

#### 1. Vision Comprehension
Extract and understand:
- Core value proposition from lib-overview.md
- Target developer personas and their pain points
- Unique differentiators that must be preserved
- Success metrics and validation criteria
- **Technical domain complexity** (crypto, protocols, ML, etc.)

#### 2. Milestone Evaluation with Complexity Assessment
For each milestone in milestones.md, assess:
- **Developer Impact**: How much value does this deliver?
- **Validation Potential**: Can success be measured quickly?
- **Foundation Value**: Does this enable future milestones?
- **Scope Clarity**: Is the scope well-defined and achievable?
- **Technical Risk Level**: Domain-specific complexity (crypto, protocols)
- **AI Assistance Viability**: High/Medium/Low AI effectiveness areas

#### 3. API Surface Analysis with Domain Context
From api.md, identify:
- Core APIs needed for selected milestone
- Integration points with existing tools
- Developer workflow implications
- Error handling requirements
- **Domain-specific considerations** (crypto libraries, protocol compliance)

<example>
**Good Milestone Selection with Complexity Flag:**
"Milestone 1: Core Connection API" - Enables basic library usage, easily testable, foundation for everything else
**Technical Complexity**: Medium - WebSocket protocol compliance needed

**Flag High-Complexity Early:**
"Milestone 2: Cryptographic Core" - Essential foundation, high complexity
**Technical Complexity**: HIGH - Custom crypto implementation, requires library integration expertise
</example>

## Enhanced Selection Criteria

### Primary Criteria (Must Have)
- **Immediate Value**: Developers can use it right away
- **Clear Success**: Obvious way to test if it works
- **Manageable Scope**: Completable in 1-2 weeks
- **Foundation Building**: Enables subsequent milestones

### Secondary Criteria (Nice to Have)
- **High Visibility**: Showcases the library's unique value
- **Quick Wins**: Builds momentum for the project
- **Market Validation**: Tests core assumptions with real developers
- **Community Building**: Attracts early adopters and contributors

### Technical Complexity Assessment
Score technical complexity (1-5 scale):

| Area | Complexity | AI Effectiveness | Planning Notes |
|------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Crypto | 5 | Low | Library integration, need fallbacks |
| Protocols | 4 | Low-Medium | Spec compliance critical |
| APIs | 2 | High | AI excellent for boilerplate |
| Testing | 3 | High | AI great for test generation |

### Evaluation Matrix
Score each milestone (1-5 scale):

| Milestone | Dev Value | Testability | Scope | Foundation | Tech Risk | Total |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| M1        | 5         | 5           | 4     | 5          | 2         | 21    |
| M2        | 3         | 4           | 5     | 3          | 5         | 20    |
| M3        | 4         | 2           | 3     | 2          | 3         | 14    |

## Analysis Deep Dive

### Developer Journey Mapping
Map the selected milestone to developer experience:

1. **Discovery**: How do developers find and evaluate the capability?
2. **First Usage**: What's the absolute minimum viable interaction?
3. **Success Moment**: When do developers realize the value?
4. **Integration**: How does this fit into their existing workflow?
5. **Expansion**: What do they want to do next?

### Requirements Surface Area with Technical Domains
Identify what needs detailed requirements gathering:

#### Core Functionality Requirements
- Primary APIs and their behavior
- Input validation and error handling
- Performance expectations
- Integration capabilities
- **Domain-specific compliance** (protocols, standards)

#### Developer Experience Requirements  
- Installation and setup process
- Documentation and examples needed
- Debugging and troubleshooting support
- Migration or upgrade paths
- **Technical expertise assumptions** (crypto knowledge, protocol familiarity)

#### Validation Requirements
- Success criteria and metrics
- Testing approaches for each user story
- Feedback collection mechanisms
- Iteration and improvement processes
- **Domain-specific validation** (crypto correctness, protocol compliance)

<example type="invalid">
**Avoid Technical Implementation Focus:**
- "How should we structure the codebase?"
- "What testing framework should we use?"
- "Which CI/CD pipeline is best?"

**Focus on Developer Needs with Domain Context:**
- "What crypto knowledge should developers have?"
- "How should protocol errors be communicated to developers?"
- "What crypto library examples would make the API clear?"
</example>
