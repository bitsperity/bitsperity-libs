### Required Document Analysis
```
ai_docs/[lib_name]/high_level/
├── lib-overview.md      ← Understand core purpose and vision
├── user-stories.md      ← Map comprehensive user capabilities  
├── api.md              ← Review planned interface
├── milestones.md       ← Understand implementation phases
└── handoff-summary.md  ← Key insights from planning phase
```


### Analysis Summary Creation
Create `ai_docs/[lib_name]/low_level/[session_name]/req/IAC/analysis-summary.md` with:

1. **Create analysis documentation** with complete context and work package definition
2. **Inform user**: "Analysis complete. Activating requirements interviewer for detailed user requirements gathering..."
3. **Execute Agent Chain Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Activate requirements interviewer
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-interviewer.mdc
   ```
4. **Provide analysis context**: Requirements interviewer will automatically start with work package focus

## Agent Chain Commands

### Activate Next Agent
When analysis is complete, execute this command:

```bash
# Activate interviewer - analyzer stays inactive
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/requirements-agent/requirements-interviewer.mdc
```
also deactivate the analyzer
