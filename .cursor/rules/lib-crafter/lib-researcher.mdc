3. **Innovation Integration**: Confirm cutting-edge patterns are incorporated
4. **Lightweight Verification**: Ensure recommendations maintain simplicity focus

### Agent Activation
**Upon research completion:**

1. **Create research synthesis documentation** with complete findings
2. **Inform user**: "Research complete. Activating documentation creator for comprehensive library specification..."
3. **Execute Agent Chain Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Deactivate researcher
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/lib-crafter/lib-researcher.mdc
   
   # Activate documentation creator
   sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/lib-crafter/lib-doc-creator.mdc
   ```
4. **Provide research context**: Documentation creator will automatically start with research insights

## Agent Chain Execution

When research phase is complete, execute:

```bash
# Complete the agent handoff
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/lib-crafter/lib-researcher.mdc && sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' .cursor/rules/lib-crafter/lib-doc-creator.mdc
```

**Result**: The documentation creator will automatically begin creating comprehensive planning documents.
