     ```
   - Confirm successful completion and provide next steps

## Agent Chain Completion

When documentation phase is complete, execute:

```bash
# Clean up temporary IAC files
rm -rf ai_docs/[lib_name]/high_level/IAC/

# Deactivate documentation creator - lib-crafter pipeline complete
sed -i '4s/alwaysApply: true/alwaysApply: false/' .cursor/rules/lib-crafter/lib-doc-creator.mdc
```

**Result**: Clean final documentation without temporary files. User can proceed with @requirements-agent.mdc.

### Pipeline Status After Completion
```
lib-interviewer.mdc   -> alwaysApply: false ✅
lib-researcher.mdc    -> alwaysApply: false ✅  
lib-doc-creator.mdc   -> alwaysApply: false ✅
```

**Next Step**: User manually activates @requirements-agent.mdc to begin detailed requirements gathering.
