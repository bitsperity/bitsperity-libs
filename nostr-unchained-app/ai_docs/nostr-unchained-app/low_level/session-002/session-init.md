# Session 1.2: Authentication System - Initialization

## Session Overview
**Milestone**: 1 - Foundation & Authentication  
**Session**: 1.2 - Authentication System  
**Duration**: 4-5 days  
**Started**: 2025-07-27  
**Prerequisites**: Session 1.1 âœ… COMPLETED

## Session Goals
Implement comprehensive authentication system with browser extension integration, temporary key generation, and secure key management for nostr-unchained-app.

## Success Criteria (SMART)
- [ ] 100% test coverage for authentication flows
- [ ] Browser extension integration working (Alby, nos2x)  
- [ ] Temporary key generation with entropy validation
- [ ] Mobile UI components responsive on all screen sizes
- [ ] Security audit passed (no key exposure in logs/storage)
- [ ] Authentication flow completion time < 30 seconds

## Planned Implementation (4-5 Days)

### Day 1: Authentication Service Implementation
- AuthService with extension detection
- Key generation and validation
- Service integration with NostrService

### Day 2: Extension Integration and Key Management  
- Browser extension communication
- Secure key storage mechanisms
- Key import/export functionality

### Day 3: UI Components and Reactive Stores
- LoginView.svelte with mobile-first design
- AuthProvider.svelte for app-wide state
- Reactive authentication state management

### Day 4: Security Audit and Mobile Optimization
- Security review of key handling
- Mobile UI optimization and responsive design
- Privacy-focused user experience

### Day 5: Testing, Documentation, and Session Completion
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Component testing and integration tests
- Session completion documentation

## Architecture Integration Points
- **Service Layer**: AuthService integrates with ServiceContainer
- **State Management**: Reactive stores for authentication state
- **Component System**: Builds on BaseComponent foundation
- **Error Handling**: Uses centralized ErrorHandler
- **Logging**: Structured logging for auth operations
- **nostr-unchained**: Extension integration via NostrService

## Security Requirements
- No private keys in localStorage unencrypted
- Secure communication with browser extensions
- Entropy validation for temporary key generation
- Session timeout and automatic logout
- Privacy indicators in UI

## Mobile-First Design Principles
- Touch-optimized authentication flow
- Responsive design for all screen sizes  
- Native app-like onboarding experience
- Accessibility support (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Progressive enhancement
