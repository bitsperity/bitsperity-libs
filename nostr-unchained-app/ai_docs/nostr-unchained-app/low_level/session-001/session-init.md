# Session 1.1: Project Bootstrap & Core Infrastructure - Initialization

## Session Overview
**Milestone**: 1 - Foundation & Authentication  
**Session**: 1.1 - Project Bootstrap & Core Infrastructure  
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Started**: 2025-07-27  

## Session Goals
Establish the foundational architecture for nostr-unchained-app following the zero-monolith policy and SOLID principles.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 100% TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] Test infrastructure operational (Vitest running)
- [ ] nostr-unchained library successfully integrated
- [ ] All files under 200 lines (zero-monolith policy)
- [ ] ESLint score: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- [ ] Bundle size under 50KB gzipped (baseline)

## Planned Tasks
1. **Day 1**: Project setup and TypeScript configuration
2. **Day 2**: Service architecture and nostr-unchained integration
3. **Day 3**: Test infrastructure and error handling
4. **Day 4**: Code review, optimization, and documentation

## Architecture Decisions to Implement
- **File Structure**: Strict separation of concerns with max 200 lines per file
- **Service Layer**: Dependency injection pattern for testability
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript with strict mode
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2+ with 100% coverage requirement
- **Performance**: Bundle analysis and optimization from day 1

## Integration Points
- nostr-unchained library as core dependency
- SvelteKit 2.0 as application framework
- TypeScript 5.3 for type safety
- Vite 5.0 for build optimization
